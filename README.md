# ProjUNN: efficient learning of orthogonal or unitary weights by low-rank updates


## Convolutional orthogonality/unitarity constraints

To run the convolution case simply run

> python convolutional_experiment.py --unitary --dataset MNIST -lr 0.001 --projector projUNNT --optimizer SGD

with the desired settings. the projector option can be either `projUNND` or `projUNNT` for the two methods we proposed in the paper. The optimizer is either `SGD` or `RMSProp`. Note that the otpimizers (other than simple SGD) need to be rewritten to be sure that terms such as momentum etc. are computed on the gradients/projected gradients but that the update to the weights is projected (to ensure that the weights stay on the orthogonal/unitary manifolds). As of now, this code simply runs the Resnet9 model on `MNIST`, `CIFAR10`, and `CIFAR100`.

To run without the unitary constraint simply remove the `--unitary` flag.
